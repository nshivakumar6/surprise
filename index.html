							<h1>Happy 1 year, sweetums 💗💗
							</h1>
							<p class="major">This past year has been one of the best ones because of you. I wanted to make you something extra special and incorporate some of my coding skills into my 1 year gift to you, since I know you love a personal project. Here's a virtual photo album for us, with a special surprise at the very end. I love you so so so so sooooooooooooo much. Hope you enjoy ♥

							<h2>Halloweekened🧛‍♂️🎃</h2>
							<p>This is surprisingly the first picture of us I have on my phone, but maybe not so shocking since we don't really take that many pictures together. I know it's one of our favorite pics together, but still so embarrased that your parents saw it on that gift I made for you ugh. But anyways, this was such a fun memory with you. Even though idk if i remember a lot of that night to be so frank. </p>

							<h2>High walk back to Whistler 🌿🌙</h2>
							<p>This was a random selfie I took from one of those nights when we were walking back from UHouse to Whistler high. Omg in fact, I think this was the night that we came up with our secret face shake, which was one of the most ingenious things ever. You are probably my fav person to get high with bc it's literally always so much fun 😏. Also flashback to when we were high and sabrina said she really gets why we work bc that was my peak and I'll never forget that.  </p>

							<h2>Our first 5k!!!! 🏃🏃‍♀️</h2>
							<p>YAY what a great time. This was surely our first (of many) 5ks, and was genuinely one of my favorite memories ever. I've always wanted to be in a running couple so I'm so glad I pursuaded you to run this with me. And we ran it in a pretty good time too!!!! I can't wait to run more with you, sweetums. </p>

						<h2>Your trip for my birthday 🎂🎂 </h2>
						<p>This was literally one of my most favorite memories. We didn't do a crazy amount or anything for my birthday, but something about you coming made me feel so loved and special and made it one of my favorite and most memorable birthdays ever. I had the best time ever just driving up the mountain and eating chipotle by the lake with you and watching the sunset and exploring soCal. Even though we had a jumpscare moment (plan B) during the trip (oopsies), it was one of my favorite memories in the entire world and I'll remember it forever. ♥ </p>

						<h2>Chicago!!!!! 🏙️✈️</h2>
						<p>This was also such an outstanding memory from the summer. My first trip of so many to come see you in chicago. Even though we had big plans of running around the lake and biking and that all got foiled because of how fweaking blazing hot it was, it was such a fun day regardless. I loved walking all around and trying the veggie hot dog and phillz with you, and the concert was also so much fun. It was such a core memory and I could never ever get tired of just walking around and yapping to you for 10000000 years.  </p>

						<h2>Morning walks to Momonoki ☕🌞</h2>
						<p>I had to include an image from this semester, and I literally have none bruh except this one that you judged me for taking until you realized my artistic vision. I love our morning tradition of getting coffee and newly now playing pickleball. Im so glad i've found someone else to match my coffee addiction. I think I'd say we did pretty good on our coffee tour around Atlanta so far :D can't wait to start it in Chicagooooooooooo</p>

							<h2>Don't forget all of the .5s! 🤡🤳</h2>
							<p>It was frankly a struggle to find good pictures of us -- we need to take more. I only have awful .5s from obscene angles of us, so I just had to include it in here. I hope you enjoy this wonderful selection of images. I'm sure you have worse of me. </p>

					<h2>THE FUN SURPRISE 🪄🎲🧩</h2>

						I know you love your NYT games so... here are some ones especially made for you! 
						It's not as good as coding up a replica NYT app, but I hope it'll do for now. 
						I've grown to love our NYT game time, and I've had this idea for quite a while now. 
						Enjoy, sweeties!
